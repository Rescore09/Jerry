## üìå Overview

Jerry is a discord bot I build long ago with malicous intents of giving an easy way to steal minecraft sessions tokens. I have long since stopped, and decided to release the source to the public, I hope you do not use this for any malicous intents, However it has the malicious capabilities.

This bot is built on [`discord.py`](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and acts as a **build manager** inside Discord.  
It allows authorized users to:

- Control access via an **admin-only allowlist**
- Generate builds (currently malware stubs ‚Äì should be replaced with safe builds)
- Log build history per user
- Upload build artifacts to remote services
- Provide a **modern Rich-based CLI dashboard** when the bot starts

While originally designed for unsafe purposes, the framework is highly reusable for enterprise-grade tooling. With minimal refactor, it can be turned into:

- ‚úÖ CI/CD build trigger bot
- ‚úÖ Deployment artifact uploader (AWS S3, Google Drive, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Secure access-controlled tool distribution bot

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Access Control**  
  Admins can add/remove users who are allowed to run `/build`.

- **Build Command**  
  Authorized users can trigger a build (currently compiles a malicious stub, but can be reworked to trigger a real build system).

- **Build Logging**  
  Logs each build to a JSON file for accountability.

- **Upload Handling**  
  Uses `aiohttp` to upload artifacts to external file hosts (replace with enterprise storage).

- **Error Handling & Embeds**  
  All errors and outputs are returned as rich Discord embeds for clarity.

- **CLI Dashboard**  
  On startup, the bot shows a styled dashboard using `rich` with status messages and progress bars.

   cd repo
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Core dependencies:

   * `discord.py`
   * `aiohttp`
   * `rich`
   * `colorama`
   * `cryptography`

3. **Configure the bot**

   * Set your Discord bot token in the source (replace placeholder in `bot.run("TOKEN")`).

4. **Run the bot**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```


## Task list
This project was made some time ago and was kept private. I have decided to release it as a way to educate others on how to create a discord bot that builds malware and returns the original. This project was built on the  [`Nyx Builder`](https://github.com/rescore09/nyx) project. The discord bot's source code is a direct 1:1 with it's logic with some updates. I have plans to update this along with its source. Here are the short term plans:
 
* Implement a proper encryption for the `source.py`
* Rewrite the `main.py` to use cogs as a way to organize files efficently.
* Replace the `allowed.rsc` and the `blacklisted.rsc` with a proper `users.db`.
* Currently the `source.py` only extracts Minecraft Session Tokens if any instance of minecraft or a modified client is running. However, I plan on adding a system that works without the presence of a minecraft instance.
* Improve build times for faster responses
* Replace all requests in `source.py` that use `requests` library with a custom undetectable one.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal & Ethical Warning

* Do **not** use this bot to build or distribute malware.
* This project should only be used as a **learning resource** for Discord bot development and DevOps automation.
* The maintainer of this repository are **not responsible** for misuse.
